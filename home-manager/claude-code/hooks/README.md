# Claude Code Hooks

The Claude Code hooks have been migrated to the cc-tools project.

## Repository

See https://github.com/Veraticus/cc-tools for the current implementation.

## Usage

The hooks are now implemented in Go as part of cc-tools and run via the systemd service.

The wrapper scripts are generated by default.nix and installed to ~/.claude/hooks/:
- `lint.sh` - Runs `cc-tools lint` (PostToolUse hook for linting)
- `test.sh` - Runs `cc-tools test` (PostToolUse hook for testing)
- `statusline.sh` - Runs `cc-tools statusline` (status line generation)
- `ntfy-notifier.sh` - Sends notifications via ntfy.sh (Stop hook)

The cc-tools hooks communicate with the daemon via Unix socket at `/run/user/$(id -u)/cc-tools.sock`.

## Future Plans

The `ntfy-notifier.sh` script may eventually be integrated into cc-tools as part of a comprehensive notification system. See `~/nix-config/docs/claude-notify-go-design.md` for the full design.
