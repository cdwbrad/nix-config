# Message Comparison: Before and After Commit 4dbef6f

## Summary of Changes

The commit 4dbef6f ("Make hook output slightly less verbose") reduced verbosity while maintaining critical error messaging. Here's a detailed comparison:

## smart-lint.sh

### Before (Verbose)

## Key Observations

### What Was Preserved (Critical Information)
1. **Error details** - The actual error output from linters/tests is still shown
2. **Blocking nature** - Clear messaging that issues are blocking
3. **Exit codes** - Still exits with code 2 for Claude to see
4. **Success message** - Still tells Claude to continue

### What Was Removed (Verbosity)
1. **Headers** - Only shown in debug mode now
2. **Progress messages** - "Running X linters..." only in debug
3. **Decorative boxes** - Removed `‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê` borders
4. **Detailed next steps** - Simplified to one-line messages
5. **Summary section** - No longer lists all errors again

### Impact Assessment

**Positive Changes:**
- Less noise during normal operation
- Faster to see actual errors
- Cleaner output for Claude to parse
- Debug mode available for troubleshooting

**Potential Concerns:**
- Loss of "NEXT STEPS" guidance might make it less clear what to do
- No visual separation (boxes) might make errors less prominent
- Progress indication lost (might seem hung on large projects)

**Clarity Impact:**
- The blocking nature is still clear with `‚õî BLOCKING` and `‚ùå` symbols
- Error details are preserved (most important part)
- Success/failure state is still obvious
- Overall clarity is maintained while reducing verbosity
